# Tailwind CSS Unexpected Text Overflow Bug

This repository demonstrates an uncommon layout issue in Tailwind CSS where long strings within a div cause unexpected text overflow, even with what appears to be correct styling. The issue is particularly noticeable in certain browsers or with specific text content.

## Bug Description
A simple div with some text styled using Tailwind classes shows unexpected behavior when the text length increases significantly. The text overflows its container, which shouldn't happen given the styling.

## Reproduction Steps
1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies (if any).
3. Run the application (instructions may vary depending on your setup).
4. Observe the unexpected text overflow in the `MyComponent` component.

## Solution
The solution involves using techniques like `text-ellipsis`, `overflow-hidden`, or potentially adjusting the container's width with `max-w` or `min-w` depending on the layout's context.  See `MyComponentSolution.js` for a possible fix.
